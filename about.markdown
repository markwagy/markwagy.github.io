This site is a work in progress; but so am I. So please check back again for more content on both of us as time progresses.

### Some High Level Information

At a high level, I'm generally associated with data and artificial intelligence work (really two sides of the same coin these days). I've worked in both engineering and analytical capacities (read: data science and research) at individual contributor and leadership levels. And I teach as a professor of AI on the side. I also partake in a bit of entrepreneurship here and there.

### Contact

The best way to contact me is through my main university affiliation email address or my personal email. 

- My main university affiliation email is the first initial of my first name followed by my last name (nothing in between) at northeastern.edu 

- My personal email is my first name separated by "." then my last name at gmail.com
